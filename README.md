🖐️ **AI-Based Hand Gesture Mouse Controller | Computer Vision + Python**

🚀 I recently built an innovative **Hand Gesture Mouse Control System** using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **PyAutoGUI** that allows users to control their mouse pointer entirely through hand movements—no physical contact needed!

🔍 **Project Overview:**
Using just a webcam, this system tracks your hand in real time, moves the mouse using the **wrist landmark**, and enables:

* **Left Click** with a thumb–index finger pinch
* **Scroll Action** with a wide finger spread
* **Always-on-top interface** for seamless control

⚙️ **Tech Stack:**

* Python
* OpenCV
* MediaPipe Hands (by Google)
* PyAutoGUI for system control
* Windows API (win32gui, pygetwindow) for UI management

🎯 **Key Features:**
✅ Real-time hand tracking
✅ Natural mouse movement using landmark prediction
✅ Touchless click & scroll using finger gestures
✅ Custom gesture thresholding for accuracy
✅ Automatically stays on top of all windows

💡 **Use Cases:**

* Accessibility solutions for differently-abled users
* Gesture-based interfaces for presentations, kiosks, or AR setups
* Fun, contactless computing demos and experimentation
